# Security Assessment Report

## Overview
This assessment reviews the Next.js hotel booking platform for security weaknesses. The focus areas were API routes, authentication flows, configuration handling, and data storage. The latest remediation cycle applied consistent authentication/authorization to privileged routes, added payload validation across mutation handlers, enforced middleware checks for admin pages, and properly redacted sensitive configuration values. The summary below reflects the current status after those fixes.

## Critical Severity Findings

### 1. No server-side authentication or authorization on remaining API routes
- **Status:** **Resolved.** All privileged API handlers now verify Firebase ID tokens via `requireAuth`/`requireRole` and restrict access to the requesterâ€™s role. Messaging, partner settings, support, alerts, security analytics, partner applications, and `[id]` resources (users, hotels, bookings) now enforce participant/admin checks, blocking anonymous or unauthorized access.

### 2. Administrative configuration endpoint leaks payment secrets
- **Status:** **Resolved.** `GET /api/settings` remains admin-only and now redacts `payments.stripeSecretKey`, `payments.paypalClientSecret`, and `email.smtpPassword` before returning the document (including new or existing records).

## High Severity Findings

### 3. ImageKit authentication parameters exposed publicly
- **Affected area:** `GET /api/upload`
- **Issue:** The endpoint previously returned ImageKit authentication parameters generated with the private API key without any access control.
- **Impact:** Unauthenticated users could obtain valid upload signatures and abuse the ImageKit account for arbitrary file storage, potentially incurring cost and enabling malicious content hosting.
- **Recommendation:** Require authenticated users, limit access to trusted roles, and generate short-lived tokens on demand. Consider moving signature generation to a dedicated secure service.
- **Status:** **Resolved.** Both `GET` and `POST` now invoke `requireAuth`, preventing unauthenticated access. Further tightening by restricting to specific roles is still recommended.

### 4. Mass-assignment enables privilege escalation
- **Status:** **Resolved.** All mutation endpoints (messages, partner settings, support, alerts, security, partner applications, hotels, bookings, and user management) now validate payloads with Zod schemas and update whitelisted fields explicitly, preventing arbitrary field injection or role escalation.

### 5. Client-side-only protection for admin and partner routes
- **Status:** **Resolved.** Middleware now requires a Firebase bearer token (via header or signed cookie) and verifies admin privileges by calling a secured `/api/auth/verify-admin` endpoint before serving any `/admin` path. The client automatically attaches ID tokens to `/api/` requests and maintains a short-lived cookie, closing the previous bypass.

## Medium Severity Findings

### 6. Information disclosure via diagnostic endpoints
- **Affected area:** `GET /api/test-db`
- **Issue:** Endpoint previously revealed database collection counts and error messages to anonymous callers.
- **Impact:** Provided reconnaissance data to attackers and confirmed database structure.
- **Recommendation:** Restrict to authenticated admins or remove in production builds.
- **Status:** **Resolved.** The route now calls `requireRole(request, 'admin')` before executing.

## Additional Recommendations
- Continue monitoring token issuance and refresh flows to ensure clients always send current Firebase ID tokens.
- Implement rate limiting and audit logging for sensitive operations once authentication is in place.
- Review `.env.local` handling to ensure secrets are not committed and are rotated after remediation.

Remediating the critical findings should be prioritized before deploying or exposing the platform to real users.
